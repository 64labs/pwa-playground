# pwa-playground
A simple Vite project for rapid experimentation. The app is not using SSR. It should just serve as a development environment for quickly trying out and/or prototyping ideas. Its just quicker than using PWAKit's dev environment. 

Clone and run with `npm run dev`.

Check out the [Vite Docs](https://vitejs.dev/) for more.
